# In Situ Machine Learning for Computational Fluid Dynamics

CFDML is a Python based tool designed to facilitate the application of machine learning (ML) to the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and turbulence modeling.
It provides a number of useful features, including:
* PyTorch implementation of multiple [models](#models) for CFD applications
* Distributed data-parallel training with Horovod and DDP
* Traditional offline training approach and the more novel online (aka in situ) approach
* Integration with any CFD code (training and inference)
* Integration with vtk for visualization of data with Paraview
* Portable across HPC hardware (CPU and Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPU)
