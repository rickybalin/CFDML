# Data Driven Sub-Grid Stress (SGS) Modeling of Turbulent Flows

## To Do
- [ ] Perform offline training of anisotropic SGS ANN model on flat plate DNS data
  - [ ] Train model on a single snapshot and a single filter width
  - [ ] Train model on a single snapshot and multiple filter widths
- [ ] Perform a priori tests of models trained on flat plate DNS data
  - [ ] Decide what flow to use, $Re_\theta=1000$ or also $Re_\theta=2000$?
  - [ ] Compare to current HIT trained model
  - [ ] Look at model performance at various heights off the wall-normal
  - [ ] Look at model performance at various streamwise locations (e.g., near STG inflow)
- [ ] Perform a posteriori tests
  - [ ] Decide what case to use
