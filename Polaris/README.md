## Building SmartSim and SmartRedis on Polaris
Polaris is a 560 node HPE Apollo 6500 Gen 10+ based system located at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF). 
Each node has a single 2.8 GHz AMD EPYC Milan 7543P 32 core CPU and four NVIDIA A100 GPUs connected via NVLink, and a pair of Slingshot 11 network adapters.
You can find more information about the system, how to log in, how to submit jobs, and much more, on the [Polaris documentation](https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/getting-started/).

Instructions detailing how to build SmartSim and SmartRedis on Polaris, which are needed to perform online training and inference, are also available at this [documentation page](https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/workflows/smartsim/).
